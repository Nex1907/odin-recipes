Here’s how to whip up a pan of baked sheet pan quesadillas that are so good, everyone will be begging for more.</p>

    <h2>How to make quesadillas in the oven</h2>

    <p>You can use this method to make any type of quesadilla in the oven: fillings are up to you! (Though we’ve shared our favorite filling below with smoked mozzarella…so good!) Here are the basic steps for how to make baked quesadillas instead of using a skillet:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.</li>
        <li>Brush a baking sheet with olive oil. Place tortillas on the sheet (rub them in a bit so they get coated with oil).</li>
            <li>Add toppings, taking care not to overfill! </li>
                <li>Fold over the quesadilla into a half-circle. (This makes it easier to flip.)</li>
                    <li>Bake 8 minutes, then flip and bake 6 to 7 minutes more until golden brown. Cut into pieces and serve immediately.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>½ cup canned black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>1 drizzle olive oil</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon each cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, and kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 large or 2 small green onions</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup smoked mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup pico de gallo</li>
        <li>8 6” tortillas (flour or corn)</li>
        <li>For topping: Guacamole, sour cream, salsa, cilantro</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>Drain the rinse the beans, then mix them with the olive oil and seasonings. Thinly slice the green onion. </li>
        <li>Brush a baking sheet with a bit of olive oil. Place the tortillas on the sheet and rub them to coat them in olive oil. </li>
        <li>On each tortilla, place 2 tablespoons cheddar cheese, 1 tablespoon seasoned beans, 1 tablespoon green onion, 2 tablespoons smoked mozzarella, 1 tablespoon pico de gallo, and 1 pinch kosher salt. If desired, add a drizzle of hot sauce. Fold over the tortilla into a half circle (this makes it easy to flip, instead of making full quesadillas with 2 tortillas). Complete for each tortilla, then brush the tops with oil. </li>
        <li>Bake 8 minutes. Then flip and bake 6 to 7 minutes more until browned and crisp on the outside. Cut into 3 wedges each with a pizza cutter. Serve topped with cilantro and sour cream, and with guacamole and extra pico de gallo for dipping.</li>
