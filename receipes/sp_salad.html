    <P><EM>This spinach apple salad with balsamic dressing is so easy and SO good, it will be your new go-to! No one will believe it took minutes to put together. </EM></P>
    <p>     Salads are a staple in our house. But Alex and I often fall into the trap of thinking the salad is the “easy” part and save it until the last minute. When it’s too late, we realize it has more prep work than we imagined! So when it comes to our favorite salads, they’re ultra simple. Might we present: our new favorite go-to that will become your favorite too. Spinach apple salad! It’s got a tangy balsamic dressing and crunchy maple-glazed walnuts (or pecans). No one will believe it took only minutes to put together! It’s that good.</p>
    <h2>What makes this a great spinach apple salad?</h2>
    <p>There are so many boring spinach salads, and this one is anything but! It doesn’t have fancy ingredients or flavors, but it’s got seriously good flavor and you can make it in minutes. It’s a plant based, healthy side dish that pairs with anything from pizza to mac and cheese to salmon to lasagna. Here are the elements that make this one great salad:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Apple & pear:</strong> Instead of straight apple, we threw in a pear for depth of sweet flavor.</li>
   <li> <strong>Spinach & baby greens:</strong> A salad of straight up spinach can be overwhelming. We like to pair our spinach with mixed baby greens for a variety of textures and flavors.</li>
</ul>

    <li>½ cup Glazed Walnuts or Glazed Pecans (or toasted walnuts or toasted pecans)</li>
